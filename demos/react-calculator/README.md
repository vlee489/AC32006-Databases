Essentially a basic Next.js Calculator, I created using mathjs although the code is almost entirely from a tutorial video by Youtuber Brice Ayres, I just use next.js instead of create-react-app essentially. He didn't include a license with his code so he reserves the right for this to be taken down at any time. Please check out his Youtube video though, it's a really great tutorial.

His Github repository: https://github.com/MyNameIsURL/react-calculator-app
